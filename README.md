Raman spectral database of biological products
	The identification of biological products, such as vaccines, blood components and recombinant therapeutic proteins, involve diverse challenges. This study introduces a novel method that employs Raman spectroscopy with a transformer model enhanced by helix matrix transformation for the robust identification of 37 distinct biological products. To satisfy the data volume requirements for model training, we generated 133,200 simulated spectra using an innovative approach. Here, the simulated spectra can be downloaded for research use.
